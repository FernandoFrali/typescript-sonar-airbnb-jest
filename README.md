# typescript-sonar-airbnb-jest
A template for TypeScript, Sonar and Airbnb with Jest. A nice template to projects with a rigid typescript config.

## How to install?
Just click on "Use this template" -> "Create a new repository", config with your settings and "git clone" your repository.
Now, you just need to change some settings on your package.json file, like: name, description, main, or add scripts and dependencies (if you want).
